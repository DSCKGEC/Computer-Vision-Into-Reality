## Description

How many are fascinated by the hologramic keyboard shown in numerous sci-fic movies ? Here we are going to build a similar type project where one can draw with
the help of their finger tips and even choose colours !

## Project structure

```
To be updated soon....
```

## Getting started
### This is a project that mainly uses opencv-python to build an app which draws lines based on the movements of your fingers. You can change the colour of the lines as well. One doesn't need to be an absolute expert in opencv to get started in project but you will need a little bit of opencv knowledge however. 

### Prerequisites
#### Just a simple laptop with internet connection will do. However don't forget to keep anaconda installed. 


### Installing
#### Step 1: clone the repository
#### Step 2: Create a conda environment with "conda create -n 'name of the environment'" and then activate the environment with "conda activate 'name of the environment'"
#### Step 3: If your conda environment already has pip installed then move to the step 4 otherwise run "conda install pip"
#### Step 4: Install the packages that are located in the requirements.txt file with "pip install 'name of the package'"
#### Step 5: After you are done installing, open the code in any code editor and run the code.py file inside the Air_Canvas folder

#### Software Needed
 
  1. A web browser. 

         OR
         
  2. Anaconda software.

#### Knowledge Needed
- Very basic understanding of git and github:

    1.  What are repositories (local - remote - upstream), issues, pull requests
    2.   How to clone a repository, how to fork a repository, how to set upstreams
    3.   Adding, committing, pulling, pushing changes to remote repositories

- For Computer Visualization
 
    1. Basic syntax and working of ```python```.(This is a must)
    2. Basic knowledge of ```opencv``` library. [Reading this blog might help.](https://docs.opencv.org/master/)
    3. Basic knowledge of ```numpy``` library. [Reading this blog might help.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/numpy/index.htm)
    4. Basic knowledge of ```collections``` library. [Reading this blog might help.](https://stackabuse.com/introduction-to-pythons-collections-module/)

  However the code is well explained, so anyone knowing the basics of Python can get a idea of what's happenning and contribute to this. 
 


## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. 
Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. 
Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

### Guidelines

- Before starting to work on any issue or feature, open an issue explaining the changes you want to make and wait for any of the project maintainers to assign it to you.
- Once the issue has been assigned, we'd recommend you creating a new branch with name `issue-xx` where xx is the issue number that you were assigned to.
- Use better commit messages that explain the changes you make. View the example below:
    - Bad commit message: `updated readme`
    - Good commit message: `updated contributors list in readme`
- You **should not**, in any case, use resources or code snippets from sources that do not allow their public use.

### Steps to follow for Pull Request

- Create a folder in your repo in the notebook folder, which will contain a new notebook which solves a feature. Note that all issues dont require to create a folder. If required, it will be clearly mentioned.
- Before Submitting the PR, make sure to have a link of colab notebook of the feature/issue solved so that we can check easily. This even applies to those who are doing on anaconda.
